The two chat briefly as they look over a pair of scrolls made of light\u2014one gold, one pale blue. You\u2019re not sure what they\u2019re doing, but after a moment they give each other a playful high five and head off in different directions. Perhaps when you see them next you'll learn what they're up to."
