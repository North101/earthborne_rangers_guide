As you approach the summit, you look out and see almost\nthe entirety of the Valley stretching to the south. White Sky Lake\nglimmers below, then, following the thread of the Silverfin River, you\ncan spot the thin, gleaming spike of Spire in the distance. Beyond,\nyou imagine you can see the mouth of the Valley, where the ground\ndrops away into the emerald expanse of the Verdessa below."
