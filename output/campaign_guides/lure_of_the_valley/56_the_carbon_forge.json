Once beyond the wall, you\ncan see the squat bulbous shape of the Forge itself, a gray kiln larger\nthan three wagons. As you watch, a trio of sweating artificers haul a\nseries of heavy curved beams out of the Forge\u2019s mouth; frames for a\nroof. Another rushes forward to shovel graphite shards into a small\nhatch on the side. Blue sparks flicker within, and your hair stands on\nend as the Forge begins to reform the graphite into nano-assembled\ncarbon items."
