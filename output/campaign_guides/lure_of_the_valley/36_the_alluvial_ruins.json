There you\nfind a jumbled mix of ruined buildings, huge boulders, and massive\nchunks of masonry. You recognize the masonry as the same material\nthat made up the great dam that collapsed and left the Fractured\nWall to the north. For here is the debris left by the cataclysmic flood\ncaused by that collapse; the ruins of the lost Estian civilization."
