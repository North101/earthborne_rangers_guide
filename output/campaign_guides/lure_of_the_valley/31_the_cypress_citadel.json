Cypresses rise up on all sides, their branches intermeshing to form\nwalls of leaves. The \u201cfloor\u201d is a thin pool of still water that stretches\nfrom one end of the space to the other. Only a few centimeters deep,\nit reflects the filtered light back into the branches, giving the Cypress\nCitadel a green, diffuse glow."
