You look up to see the\ndreaded specters known collectively as the Tenebrae drifting slowly\noverhead. Sounds of life grow still under their shadow. You hear a\nnear inaudible sound that claws at the edges of your perception, like a\nchorus of labored breaths, wheezing through a single narrow aperture."
