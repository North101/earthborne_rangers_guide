Here the air is a bit damp, but you\nfind yourself in a brightly lit chamber full of cabinets and pedestals.\nArtifacts are scattered throughout the space, each with a neat label\nidentifying them. Most seem to be from the Estians. Some seem even\nolder, from the decades before the Guide led people to begin the Generational Projects."
