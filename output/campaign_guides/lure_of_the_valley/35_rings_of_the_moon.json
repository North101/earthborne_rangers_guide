Some have broken into half- or quarter-circles,\nbut a few are still intact. The locals in Meadow say that if you go to\nthe edges of the Valley with a scope and look back through all the\nloops at once, you\u2019ll see another world in a reality just sideways from\nyour own. Almost every artificer who\u2019s inspected the rings, however,\nbelieves they are part of a vast (and nonfunctional) sensor network."
