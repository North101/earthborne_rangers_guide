Built upon a well-preserved Estian ruin,\nthe station is the vision of the artificer Bael Orlin, son of the legendary\nartificer Mora Orlin. He designed the exterior to reflect the symmetry\noften found in Estian architecture while paying homage to the nautical\nengineers of the ancient past, whom the Orlins hold in high regard as\npioneers in artificing."
