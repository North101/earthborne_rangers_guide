An invigorating stillness\nfills the air, and for an undefinable moment, you are absorbed\ninto the delicate play of color and light as the sun splashes across\nthe landscape. Green, blue and auburn tints shimmer before you,\nchameleon-like, across the Valley floor. Then a swath of color several\nhundred meters ahead catches your gaze as it starts to sway."

An awkward\nlurch, and you catch the outline of an enormous being lumbering\nthrough the underbrush. Its body is covered in vines, roots and\nbranches, as if the earth itself has risen up and begun to walk."
